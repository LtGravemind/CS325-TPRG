==========

Welcome to Shadows of the Knight, a turn-based tactics game based in a medieval
setting, where lords take command of armies and pit them against one another.
More than a game where you simply hope that your unit roles a higher attack
that your opponent's, your ability to take advantage of terrain and maneuver
your units will determine your ability to succeed.

The controls are simple: click on the unit you which to use and either move
them or attack an enemy unit (press space if you do not wish to take either
action). Currently selected units and possible move options are represented by
green outlines, player 1 units are represented by yellow outlines, and player 2
units are represented by blue outlines. When you want to skip a unit's turn,
select them and press the spacebar. Currently, there is no AI in place, so
ideally, you should grab a partner and choose which player is who.

The goal in the game is to eliminate all of the opponent's units before they
eliminate yours, and to do that, you need to know the units in your arsenal:
* Cavalier: 3 movement, 1 range, 75 health, 3 attack, 1 defense.
  A swift striker unit with low defense, the Cavalier is useful for harassing
  enemy units and chasing after fleeing Archers.
* Archer: 2 movement, 3 range, 50 health, 1 attack, 1 defense.
  A long range attacker, best used to soften enemy lines. Archers are capable
  of landing a shot from long range and retreating before Knights can catch up.
* Knight: 1 movement, 1 range, 100 health, 3 attack, 3 defense.
  A slow and heavy melee attacker, great at holding lines. Knights can be
  harried by faster units. Ideal for slowly force an enemy back into a corner
  with no escape.

Movement and attack ranges are measured in grid units, so any count of grid
units per stat is ideal, assuming you are not attempting to move into an
already occupied.

Recommended Strategies:
* Keep your Archers and Cavaliers away from Knights. Knights will tend to bunch
  together and engulf enemies, and your non-Knights are your most versatile
  units.
* Destroy your enemy's Archers and Cavaliers. They will harass and make your
  life difficult throughout the game.
* Keep your Knights moving forward at all times. Eventually they will either
  force the enemy back or cause them to split, severely limiting the enemy's
  effectiveness.
* Use Cavaliers to assault enemy Archers. Cavaliers can keep enemy Archers
  running while escaping any read danger.
* Focus your Archers' attacks. They quicker they can bring down enemies at
  range, the safer your units will be.
